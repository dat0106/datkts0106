DocBook stylesheets for HTML5 output - BETA 3
=============================================

This directory contains a beta version of XSL stylesheets
for generating HTML5 output from DocBook 4 content.
The stylesheets should work for DocBook5 content by first
stripping off the namespace, but that feature has not
yet been extensively tested.

The output of these stylesheets is the XML serialization of
HTML5.  There is no provision for generating the HTML
serilization of HTML5 with these stylesheets.

These HTML5 stylesheets are also used by the beta EPUB3
stylesheets included in this distribution.

Changes in beta 3
------------------

1.  For videoobject or audioobject, process any associated
textobject into the fallback content of the video or audio
output element.


Installation
--------------
These stylesheets are customizations of the
existing stylesheets in the "xhtml/" directory in
the docbook-xsl-1.76.1 distribution.  This archive
should be unzipped within your local installation of
docbook-xsl-1.76.1.  It will create two new directories:

docbook-xsl-1.76.1/xhtml5
docbook-xsl-1.76.1/epub3

There are relative paths in the files that rely on
this arrangement of files.

Usage
-----------
You should be able to apply any of these stylesheet files
to a DocBook document as with any other DocBook stylesheet:

xhtml5/docbook.xsl         - Single file output.
xhtml5/chunk.xsl           - Chunked output.
xhtml5/profile-docbook.xsl - Profiled single file output.
xhtml5/profile-chunk.xsl   - Profiled chunk output.
xhtml5/chunkfast.xsl       - Chunked output with precomputed chunks.


Do not attempt to directly use the following two stylesheet files:

xhtml-docbook.xsl
xhtml-profile-docbook.xsl

Those are copies of the corresponding files in the
xhtml/ directory, modified to remove the doctype
declarations in the xsl:output elements.  They were also
modified to import from the original xhtml/ directory.
They are imported by the xhtml5 stylesheet files.

CSS support
----------------
Because HTML5 requires clean HTML and CSS for styling, the xhtml5
stylesheet files make use of the following three params:

make.clean.html
docbook.css.source
custom.css.source

See the param reference for details:
   http://docbook.sourceforge.net/release/xsl/current/doc/html/

With these params set properly and the source files created, the
stylesheet can automatically generate the CSS files into the
output directory.

Testing
--------------

The HTML5 output of these stylesheets should pass the
W3C online validator, available here:

http://validator.w3.org/

Since this is a beta release, it is likely there will be
some issues that still need to be fixed.  Please report
those to the docbook-apps mailing list for now.
