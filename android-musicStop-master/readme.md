Music Stop allows you to stop your music player after a defined time. The stop method can be customized to fit with your favorite player.

* <b>Stop :</b> Press on a virtual "Stop" button (Default)
* <b>Play/Pause :</b> Press on a virtual "Play/Pause" button
* <b>Headphone plug-in and plug-out :</b> Plug your headphone and unplug them to stop the music. (Use if disconnected)
* <b>Headphone plug-out and plug-in :</b> Unplug your headphone to stop the music and plug them back.(Use if connected)
* <b>Getting noisy :</b> Simulate unplug from a docking station.
* <b>Mute :</b>Mute volume. This action doesn't stop the music and use more battery. You can restore volume by pressing the volume-up key or via "System settings" -> "Sound" -> "Volumes".

## Out-of-the-box ##

* Apollo

## Enable headset controls ##
For theses players, edit the settings and check "headsets controls".

Theses players have been reported as incompatible with this application. You should try different stop methods to make them work (or use another player). Usually, streaming players are not working (radio/cloud).

If MusicStop doesn't work with your player, try to reboot your phone or change the stop method.
